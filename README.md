# Fitness Tracker

## How to use

This Fitness Tracker is an app for keeping track of your workouts. It provides a ready-made training program for the user to follow, focused on compound exercises using free weights.
The plan consists of 2 different types of workouts, each comprised of 3 different exercises. The user should alternate between these workouts, with 1-2 days of rest between each workout.

Using the app is very simple. On the main page, the app displays the user's next workout (the exercises to be done and their weights). Once the user has done their workout, they log it into the app. Previous exercises will be stored in the log, and the app automatically calculates the next workout for the user. Included is also a timer for calculating rest time between sets (the user should rest for 3-5 minutes between sets).

On the log page the user can view their past workouts.

The about page provides information on how to use the app.
