        <h1>How To Use The Fitness Tracker</h1>
        <p>The purpose of this webapp is to help users keep track of their workouts. It provides a ready-made workout plan for you to follow.</p>
        <p>There are two different workout, A and B. The idea is to alternate between them, with 1-2 days of rest between training sessions. So in practice it would look something like this:</p>
        <ul>Week 1
            <li>Monday: Workout A</li>
            <li>Wednesday: Workout B</li>
            <li>Friday: Workout A</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>Week 2
            <li>Monday: Workout B</li>
            <li>Wednesday: Workout A</li>
            <li>Friday: Workout B</li>
        </ul>
        <p>And so on.</p>
        <p>The exercises included in the program should provide good coverage for all the major muscle groups.</p>
        <p>You should begin the program with small weights and add 2.5 kgs every time (5 kgs for deadlift). The app is built so that it will keep track of your past workouts and suggest the appropriate weights for your next workout.</p>
        <p>You should do 5x5 of each exercise, meaning 5 sets of 5 reps (1 set of 5 reps for deadlift). You should rest between 3-5 minutes between sets, the app provides a timer which you can use to keep track of rest time.</p>
